# Merge Worktree

Squash-merge the current worktree branch back into the target branch. All WIP commits become one structured commit.

## Who Runs This

This skill is invoked by the **orchestrator** after:
1. Implementer's `[agree_tag]` consensus reached
2. Implementer's WIP commit completed
3. **Retrospective protocol completed** (session-gate released via `session-self-improvement-complete`)

## Execution Context

| Context | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Interactive** | Report merge result → ask about cleanup |
| **Headless** | Merge → verify → report result → do NOT cleanup (orchestrator decides) |

In headless mode, do NOT ask "keep worktree or remove?" — report the result and exit. The orchestrator handles cleanup.

## Current Context

- Git dir: `!git rev-parse --git-dir`
- Current branch: `!git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: `!git log --oneline -20`
- Working tree status: `!git status --short`

## Instructions

Follow phases in order. Do NOT skip phases.

---

### Phase 1: Validation

1. **Verify worktree**: `git rev-parse --git-dir` must contain `/worktrees/`. If not → stop:
   > "This skill must be run from inside a git worktree."

2. **Verify retrospective complete**: Check `.claude/retro-marker.json` in the repo root:
   ```bash
   git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." cat-file -e HEAD:.claude/retro-marker.json 2>/dev/null || cat "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/../.claude/retro-marker.json" 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If `retro_pending` is `true` → stop:
   > "Retrospective not completed. Run retrospective first, then `session-self-improvement-complete`."

3. **Identify current branch**: `git branch --show-current`

4. **Resolve target branch**:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` provided → use as target
   - Otherwise → detect `main` or `master`

5. **Find original repo root**:
   ```bash
   ORIGINAL_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.."
   ```

6. **Clean working tree**: `git status --porcelain` must be empty. If not → stop:
   > "Uncommitted changes found. Commit or stash first."

---

### Phase 2: Research

1. **Commit history**: `git log --oneline <target>..HEAD`

2. **File change summary**: `git diff <target>...HEAD --stat`

3. **Full diff**: `git diff <target>...HEAD` — read carefully

4. **Read key files**: For significantly changed files, use Read to understand full context

5. **Categorize changes**:
   - Features (new functionality)
   - Fixes (bug corrections)
   - Refactors (code restructuring)
   - Tests (new or updated)
   - Docs (documentation)
   - Chore (build, CI, tooling)

---

### Phase 2.5: Doc-Sync (Automatic)

Before generating the commit message, run doc-sync to ensure documentation reflects the current code state:

1. **Spawn doc-sync agent** in headless mode — it extracts facts from code and fixes mismatches in all 8 doc files.
2. **Wait for completion** — the agent outputs a Doc-Sync Report.
3. **If fixes were made**: stage the changed doc files (`git add README.md README.ko.md docs/`). These become part of the squash commit.
4. **If no fixes needed**: proceed.

This step is automatic and does not require user confirmation. It prevents the recurring problem of documentation drifting from code across versions.

---

### Phase 3: Generate Commit Message

Structure:

```
<type>(<scope>): <summary under 72 chars>

<body — what changed and why, grouped by category>

<footer — breaking changes, issue refs, co-authors>
```

**Type rules**:
- `feat` — new functionality
- `fix` — bug correction
- `refactor` — restructuring without behavior change
- `test` — test additions/changes only
- `docs` — documentation only
- `chore` — build, CI, tooling

**Scope**: the primary module affected (e.g., `bus`, `security`, `orchestration`, `fe`)

**Body guidelines**:
- Group changes by category with `###` headers if multiple types
- Reference file paths for significant changes
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Include test results summary

**Footer**:

### Phase 4: Execute Merge

All commands use absolute paths or `git -C` — shell state does not persist between commands.

1. **Squash merge** (from original repo root):
   ```bash
   git -C "${ORIGINAL_ROOT}" merge --squash <worktree_branch>
   ```

2. **Commit with generated message**:
   ```bash
   git -C "${ORIGINAL_ROOT}" commit -m "<generated_message>"
   ```

3. **Verify merge commit exists**:
   ```bash
   git -C "${ORIGINAL_ROOT}" log -1 --oneline
   ```
   The output must show the new squash commit with the generated message. If not → **merge failed** — report error, do NOT proceed to cleanup.

4. **Verify no uncommitted changes remain**:
   ```bash
   git -C "${ORIGINAL_ROOT}" status --porcelain
   ```
   Must be empty. If not → **partial merge** — report and stop.

5. **Report result to orchestrator**:
   ```markdown
   ## Merge Complete

   - Branch: <worktree_branch> → <target_branch>
   - Commits squashed: N
   - Files changed: M
   - Commit: <short_sha> <first_line>
   - Verified: commit exists ✅, working tree clean ✅

   Worktree can be removed with:
   `git worktree remove <worktree_path>`
   ```

---

### Phase 5: Cleanup

Report to orchestrator with cleanup options:

```markdown
**Worktree merged. Cleanup options:**
1. `git worktree remove <worktree_path> && git branch -d <worktree_branch>`
2. Keep worktree for reference
```

The orchestrator decides — this skill does not remove worktrees autonomously.

## Commit Message Example

```
feat(bus): add event replay port for SSE reconnection

EventBus now supports replay_since(cursor, { team_id }) for
tenant-scoped event replay. InMemory uses ring buffer,
Redis uses XRANGE.

- src/bus/types.ts: ReplayableMessageBus interface
- src/bus/service.ts: ring buffer implementation (max 1000)
- src/bus/redis-bus.ts: XRANGE-based replay
- tests/bus/replay.test.ts: 12 tests

## Emergency Rollback

If post-merge verification fails (tests break, build fails):

1. **Identify the squash commit**: `git log -1 --oneline` → note the SHA
2. **Revert the merge commit**:
   ```bash
   git -C "${ORIGINAL_ROOT}" revert --no-edit <merge-sha>
   ```
3. **Verify revert**: `git -C "${ORIGINAL_ROOT}" diff HEAD~1..HEAD --stat` shows the inverse
4. **Run tests**: confirm the revert restores passing state
5. **Report to orchestrator**:
   ```markdown
   ## Emergency Rollback
   - Reverted: <merge-sha> (<commit message>)
   - Reason: <what failed>
   - Status: tests passing after revert
   - Action needed: task returns to `correcting` status
   ```
6. **Update handoff**: task status → `correcting`, note rollback reason

Do NOT use `git reset --hard` — revert creates an audit trail. Hard reset loses history.

## Exceptions

- Do NOT merge if `git status --porcelain` shows uncommitted changes
- Do NOT force-push after merge
- Do NOT delete the worktree without orchestrator decision
- Do NOT merge if `quorum:verify` has unresolved failures
- Do NOT merge if retrospective is pending (`retro_pending: true`)
- **Do NOT report success without verifying the squash commit exists in git log**
- **Do NOT proceed to cleanup if `git status --porcelain` shows uncommitted changes**
